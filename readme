1.Touch screen can sometimes be regarded as a keystroke by this program.

Nov. 11:
Basic function is established.
Require 5 inputs of each key in training stage.

Current code is to detecting key A B C D
if you want to train and test all keys, 
remove comment on line 36 in MainActivity.java 
AtoZ//, NUM, LEFT, RIGtextHT, BOTTOM
and change the private final int[] ExpectedInputNum = { 4, 12, 4, 11, 6 }; 
to private final int[] ExpectedInputNum = { 26, 12, 4, 11, 6 };

Todo:
1. Add clear/restart button (2 buttons) on training activity to clear training for current key/restart training, in case input error in training 
	stage
2. Enhance keystroke detection algorithm
	a. Move energy window
	b. Compare number of sample points that are greater than threshold in two window
	c. Threshold + Energy.... If find a sample point that is greater than threshold, then calculate 
		energy of next several samples and energy of previous several samples. Compare the two energy
3. Online Training--Train the FFN when testing
	Every input in testing, if not corrected by user, use this input to train the KNN
	Replacement Policy:FIFO
4. Self Correction
	pseudo code:
	clickTimes = 0;
	onClickBackSpace(){
		clickTimes ++;
	}	
	//when get new key input
	if(clickTimes == 1)
	{
		newkey = KNN.nearest(current input feature);
		if( newkey != previousKey)
		{	
			show newkey; // we think it is users input error
			clickTimes = 0; //clear the click time
		}else{
			newkey = KNN.second_nearest(current input feature);
			KNN.removeNearestPoint();
			show newkey;
		}
	}else if(clickTimes == 2) //
	{
		let the user input the correct corresponding key through screen;
		clickTimes = 0;
	}

Problems: 
1.click backspace on screen can possibly be regarded as keystroke 
2.

1. Implement online correction policy,
See function:	
private void dealwithBackSpace(double[] features)
and OnclickButtonBackSpace

2. Halt the key recognition when user input

3. Add clear and restart button on training screen

4. Add online training:
the policy is simple:
if(input is after a backSpace)
	we don't train this key;
else use our prediction to train that key;

if(preinput = recognize(user input) 
	then user click backSpace 
		then recognize(new input) == preinput
			then user clickbackSpace)  
	remove the latest training;

Also I modified a little in BasicKNN.java to implement the policies 
5. Modify BasicKNN.java
a.Modified the key training function in KNN
Add a replacement policy:
when training set is full,
remove the most far node from new node, and insert new node
b. add 1 value: trainingSize---indicate the training set size for each key
c. add 3 functons: setTrainingSize(int num), getTrainingSize and  removeLatestItem()
